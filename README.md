# Atlas V Personal Website

Welcome to the source code for  [AtlasV.info](https://atlasv.info/).

## Overview

This website serves as a personal portfolio and project showcase for the programs and utilites I have made. Along with acting as a hub for my creations, it also provides information about me and way to get in touch. 

This was my first time using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript together at this scale, there will be mistakes, errors, and things that could've been done better. 

## Features

- **Homepage**: A brief introduction to me and my work.
- **Utilities**: A collection of small tools and scripts I've created with no set theme.
- **Wiki**: Documentation and guides for my projects. (WIP)
- **RSS Feed**: Updates on new projects via an RSS feed. (May be VERY broken)

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5 & CSS3**: for the main body of the website.
- **JavaScript/jQuery**: For interactive elements, carousel functionality, and backend of utilities.
- **Slick Carousel**: For the featured projects slider.
- **Netlify**: Hosting and deployment.
